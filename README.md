# Beetle - Overview 
The main goal of this tool is to streamline some of the unexpected we often encounter when we walk in to the remote POC datacenters with unique policies and perceptions. As said, unexpected will always be there and hope to address them as much as possible using this tool. 

One of those scenarios is walking in to the lab or datacenter with no access to the internet or yum/zypper repositories. This package can be downloaded locally to your laptop or external media from GitHub and use it in those environments. The custom repositories included in this package will take care of this.

In addition, we had an opportunity to develop some useful shortcuts (unix functions to sound boring) over period of time to help with some of the frequently performed tasks. These shortcuts do assume some non-minimal packages are installed on the Linux hosts. Hence we are bundling those with the custom repos included in this package.

# How to use it

Run on any Linux host with access to github:
```
git clone https://github.com/vxtools/beetle.git
```
